This Webapp wasinitally created by Huda Abusal, Craig Guthrie and Denis. 
It is a WebApp that allows a creation of sitting (meal session) and then allows guests to make a reservation(s).


User can be either a member or non-member.
The advantage of being a member is the user does not have to fill in their personal details for subsequent reservation as their informations
are stored in the system database
